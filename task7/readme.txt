Task with "*"!
Calculates heat spreading.
To build: make
To launch: ./run.sh launches with dumping to out.txt file.

Attention:
0. Be default dump goes in console. Good to redirect output stream to file.
1. Huge dumps!
2. In case of dumping images: HUGE images.

Notes:
1. Within changing number of threads, number of iteration is changing. Think it is because of misscalculation of float pointer values.
2. Think there are a lot of cache problems.
